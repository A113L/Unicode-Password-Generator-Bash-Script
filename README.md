# Unicode-Password-Generator-Bash-Script

This is a robust Bash script for generating cryptographically secure, high-entropy passwords using a massive pool of Unicode characters.

The script is interactive, prompting the user for the password length and count. It then calculates and displays the Shannon Entropy (in bits) and an estimated strength rating before outputting the generated passwords. It uses the shuf and fold commands to ensure proper and secure randomization of Unicode characters. It also includes an option to save the generated passwords to a timestamped file.

In short, it's a secure, configurable, and Unicode-aware password generator built entirely in Bash.
